AWK, SED and GREP for biology

 

The AWK tutorial ([click here](Understanding_AWK.ipynb)) contains a (semi) quick
introduction to AWK and how to process biological data. So far I focus on how to:

* Filter SAM files by quality.
* Filter FASTA files by name or matching a sequence.
* Filter FASTQ files by matching a sequence.
* Take random samples from FASTA and FASTQ files.

The SED tutorial ([click here](Understanding_SED.ipynb)) contains a (semi) quick
introduction to AWK and how to process biological data. So far I focus on how to:

* Modify FASTA files:
	* Convert a multiline FASTA file into a two-lines-per-read format.
	* Reverse complement of a FASTA file. If it happens to be in lowercase and multiline performs same operation as above	
* Convert a FASTQ file into FASTA

This is a work in progress.
