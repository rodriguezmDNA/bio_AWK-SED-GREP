AWK, SED and GREP for biology

 

The AWK tutorial ([click here](Understanding_AWK.ipynb)) contains a (semi) quick
introduction to AWK and how to process biological data. So far I focus on how to

 

\* Filter SAM files by quality.

\* Filter FASTA files by name or matching a sequence.

\* Filter FASTQ files by matching a sequence.

\* Take random samples from FASTA and FASTQ files.

This is a work in progress.
